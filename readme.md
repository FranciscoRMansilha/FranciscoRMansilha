## üëã Introduction
Hello there! My name is Francisco Ribeiro Mansilha I am 20 years old and I study Applied Data Science and AI at BUas üôÇ

I love all things AI and Tech related and I aspire to explore and discover how data science branches can merge with other disciplines like biology, medicine, physics and finance!

### üìù What can you expect from my GitHub?

On my GitHub profile, you‚Äôll find a selection of projects I‚Äôve developed during my bachelor‚Äôs degree, both for clients and as personal endeavors. Each project is accompanied by a brief description, along with additional information about the skills I learned with them. Due to data privacy regulations, I‚Äôm unable to share all my projects publicly, so be sure to check the next section for further details. üòÅ

There is also a section of small blog posts and articles about my work and another one in which I show some of the courses and certifications I took.

|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 3D Bone Segmentation and Fracture Reduction with Reinforcement Learning ü¶¥  | Due to a signed NDA I cannot provide many details about the client or the project but I am working on a pipeline that begins with 3d bone segmentation based on CT Scans of a broken bone and ends with a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning approach to rejoin this bone's fragments together | `3d object segmentation`, `nnUnetv2`, `Reinforcement Learning`   | Not Available... For now!
| NPEC üçÉ | This project is divided into two phases. The first phase, open to all students, involved building a pipeline that processes images of Arabidopsis Thaliana seedlings in a Computer Vision pipeline. This pipeline is also integrated with a robotics system, that inoculates plants using a PID or RL algorithm in a simulated OpenTrons-2 machine. The second phase is exclusive to the five students with the best solutions, including myself. We are working closely with NPEC to improve the existing solution, deploy it on their premises.| November 2023 - Ongoing  | `Deep Learning`, `U-Net`, `Semantic Segmentation`, `Traditional CV`, `OpenCV`, `Reinforcement Learning`, `OpenAI gym`    | Soon I will be able to share details about both phases!                              |
| PyTorch Tabular üìì | I plan to create a series of notebook tutorials on how to use PyTorch Tabular to solve Tabular Data tasks like classification and regression.    | Ongoing       | `PyTorch`, `Pytorch Tabular`, `Deep Learning`        | The first tutorial is already available! Make sure to check it [here](https://github.com/FranciscoRMansilha/PyTorch-Tabular-Tutorials)  |
| Banijay Benelux  üì∫ | Me and 4 teammates developed a content classification pipeline. This enables Banijay to match emotional responses in specific segments to viewer ratings.  | February 2023 - Completed         | `Natural Language Processing`, `Transformers`, `Whisper`, `Speech-to-Text`,             | Available at this [Repository](https://github.com/FranciscoRMansilha/Emotion-Pipeline-Banijay)                                          |
| AI at BUas üéì  | We evaluated AI's influence in BUas programs by formulating a research question, hypothesis, and conducting a survey. I was assigned to focus on the Master's in Game Technology and authored a paper on the benefits of integrating Generative AI for academic writing in game development research.   | September 2023 - Finished           | `Research`, `R`, `Statistics`, `Hypothesis Testing`, `Generative AI`             | BUas Internal Use Only                                              |
| Municipality of Breda üìä | Me and four colleagues created a Streamlit app in which the municipality can monitor relevant data about the city such as nuisance complaints by neighbourhood and others... We also developed a time-series forecasting to help them predict the months in which more nuisances might occur. Lastly we also provided a summary of the insights we found   | May 2023 - Completed | `Time-Series Forecasting`, `SARIMA` `Data Analysis`,`Geodata Visulalization`, `Streamlit`, `Folium`, `statsmodels`, `GeoPandas`  | Due to data privacy concerns I am not able to share code or data about this project                                        |
| Deep Learning-based Image Classifier App üè•| My goal was to design a transparent and interpretable image classifier. I prototyped an app called "LuxTriagix," meant for large hospitals to automatically classify patients as children or adults based on a photo, and direct them accordingly to the pediatric or other facilities. | February 2023 - Finished for now| `Deep Learning`, `Image Classification`, `TensorFlow`, `Transfer Learning`, `Web Scraping`, `Gradcam`, `LIME`, `Explainable AI`,   `Python`                                  | The project is not complete but you can find a big part of it in this [Repository](https://github.com/FranciscoRMansilha/LuzTriagix) |
| Banijay Benelux üì∫ | I analyzed the influence of Twitter engagement on viewer ratings for one of Banijay's shows and created machine learning models to predict ratings based on various factors | November 2022 - Completed           | `Data Analysis`, `Traditional ML Algorithms`, `Feature Engineering`, `Supervised Learning`, `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`, `Scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`  | Due to data privacy concerns I am not able to share code or data about this project |
| Sustainable Development Goals üêü | Based on UN‚Äôs **14th** Sustainable Development Goal (Life below Water) I created a research question and problem statement. I collected relevant data and created a Power BI dashboard to answer my this question | September 2022 - Completed         | `Power BI`, `Data Analysis`, `Data Visualization`,  `Data Storytelling`                                                     | Available at this [Repository](https://github.com/FranciscoRMansilha/SDG-14_Power_BI_Dashboard) |

### ‚úç Blog Posts and Articles

<br />

- **[Francisco Ribeiro Mansilha's journey in Kaggle competitions](https://datascience-ai.buas.nl/francisco-ribeiro-mansilhas-journey-kaggle-competitions)** - This is a short article that my university wrote and shared about my progress on Kaggle.

- **[Nuisance in Amsterdam](https://wandb.ai/francisco-ribeiro-mansilha/3rd_attempt_at_LSTM/reports/First-report-Nuisance-in-Amsterdam--Vmlldzo2MTQwMjAw?accessToken=3k87ovp1elf82dmumq7pj23hz7tgqj77l0i264isw3auzmte4pw1mjd6uhinvjlh)** - To complete the course [*Effective MLOps - Model Development*](https://www.credential.net/1bad791b-7bb4-44d0-8c0b-3878fd5af84f), I was required to complete assignments by working on a project and writing reports to track my progress. I chose to base these reports on a project I came up with, tackling a forecasting problem using data on nuisance complaints in Amsterdam. In the end, I produced three reports that reflect both my learning and the development of the project. The link above is for the first report, and from there, you can easily access the following ones.
